Hi there, thanks for checking out my Github. I'm still new to it all but for now please take a look around and see what I have done and what I am doing. 

In Certifications, you can see my Certified Ethical Hacker training, should be certified in January 2025, Sec+ cert, CSM, CSPO, Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Course, Hack the box owns and training modules as of 20241227 and Salesforce points and badges.

Offensive cybersecurity is where I am learning cybersecurity. PowerPlatform is where I built some apps for the Air Force Reserve Recruiting Service and have some images of those in there, SmartChecklists is a section for some PDF javascript checklists that change based on input and the entire AF Reserve Recruiting is using and then there is my most recent resume.

Thanks again for checking me out and I hope we get to work together soon!
