Step 1: Planning and Reconnaissance
Define Scope and Rules of Engagement
Understand what is allowed and what is off-limits in your test.
Get written permission to test the target systems.
Identify Objectives
Define your goals: Are you testing for data theft, system compromise, or privilege escalation?
Gather Intelligence (Passive Reconnaissance)
Use tools like Maltego, Spiderfoot, and Tor Browser to gather OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) on the target.
Identify subdomains, employee details, email addresses, and associated infrastructure.

Step 2: Active Reconnaissance
Footprinting
Use tools like Dnsrecon and FOCA to map the network and extract sensitive metadata.
Perform Email Tracking
Tools like EmailTrackerPro can help trace email interactions and understand communication paths.
Map the Network
Use tools like Nmap and Rustscan to identify live hosts, open ports, and running services.

Step 3: Vulnerability Scanning
Scan Networks for Vulnerabilities
Use Nessus or Sniper to identify weak points in the target infrastructure.
Analyze Services
Check for misconfigurations or outdated software using Nmap Scripts or MegaPing.

Step 4: Enumeration
Gather Detailed Information
Use tools like Advanced IP Scanner, NetBIOS Enumerator, and SMBeagle to enumerate shared resources, users, and services.
Active Directory Enumeration
Use tools like LDAP Explorer or Active Directory Explorer to gather information on directory structures.
SNMP Enumeration
Tools like SoftPerfect Network Scanner can extract details from network devices.

Step 5: Exploitation
Target Vulnerabilities
Use tools like Metasploit or scripts from Github to exploit identified vulnerabilities.
For web applications, use tools like Wpscan or Dirsearch.
System Hacking
Leverage tools like CrackMapExec, Impacket, and winPEAS for privilege escalation or system compromise.
Password Cracking
Use tools like John the Ripper, Hashcat, or RainbowCrack to brute-force or crack hashes.

Step 6: Post-Exploitation
Establish Persistence
Use tools like SharPersist or Havoc to maintain access.
Deploy keyloggers or backdoors where ethical and allowed.
Clear Tracks
Use tools like Clear_Event_Viewer_Logs to hide your activities (only for simulation in ethical hacking scenarios).

Step 7: Reporting
Document Findings
Include all vulnerabilities, steps to exploit them, and screenshots of your process.
Highlight the business impact of the vulnerabilities.
Provide Recommendations
Suggest actionable steps for remediation, such as patching, configuring firewalls, or improving security protocols.

Step 8: Cleanup
Remove Backdoors
Ensure all tools, scripts, and access points are removed from the target environment.
Validate Fixes
Retest vulnerabilities to confirm they are resolved.
Return Access
Hand over control and conclude the test.
